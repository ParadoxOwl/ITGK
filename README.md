# My ITGK practice files
These are my files for the subject TDT4110 at NTNU, the fall of 2019. Copy at your own risk and effort, other than being in the correct subfolder, the files do not have logical names for people other than me, and they might not contain any comments, so it might not be woth it, though there are zips for handin and .py files straight from jupyter.
